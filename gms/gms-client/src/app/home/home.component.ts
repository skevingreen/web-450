      <h1 class="landing-page__title">Welcome to the Gardening Management System</h1>
      <p class="landing-page__paragraph">
        This application is designed to help you manage your gardens efficiently.
        You  can add, update, delete, and view details of your gardens with ease.
      </p>
      <p class="landing-page__paragraph">
        The Gardening Management System is built using the MEAN stack, which includes
        MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js.  This stack provides a robust and
        scalable solution for building modern web applications.
      </p>
      <p class="landing-page__paragraph">
        In this demonstration, you will learn how to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
        Delete) operations on garden data.  This is a fundamental skill for any web
        developer, and mastering it will give you a strong foundation in full-stack
        development.
      </p>
      <p class="landing-page__paragraph">
        Follow along with the examples and exercises in this course to gain hands-on
        experience with the MEAN stack.  By the end of this course, you will have a
        fully functional Gardening Management System that you can use as a reference
        for your own projects.
